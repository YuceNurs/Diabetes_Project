Miuul Diabetes Feature Engineering Project 

Business Problem : 
When the features are provided, it is requested to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not. Before developing the model, you are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.


Dataset :
The dataset is a part of the large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the state of Arizona, USA. The target variable is indicated as 'outcome,' where 1 denotes a positive diabetes test result and 0 denotes a negative result.

There are 9 variables in the dataset:

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Examine the overall picture.
Step 2: Capture numerical and categorical variables.
Step 3: Perform analysis of numerical and categorical variables.
Step 4: Conduct analysis of the target variable. (Mean of the target variable by categorical variables, mean of numerical variables by the target variable)
Step 5: Perform outlier observation analysis.
Step 6: Conduct missing observation analysis.
Step 7: Perform correlation analysis.


Task 2: Feature Engineering
Step 1: Perform necessary procedures for missing and outlier values. There are no missing observations in the dataset, but observations containing 0 values in variables like Glucose, Insulin, etc. may represent missing values. For example, a person's glucose or insulin value cannot be 0. Taking this into account, you can replace zero values with NaN in the relevant variables and then apply processes for missing values.
Step 2: Create new variables.
Step 3: Perform encoding processes.
Step 4: Standardize numerical variables.
Step 5: Build the model.
