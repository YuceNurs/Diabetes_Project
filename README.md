Case
When the features are provided, it is requested to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not. Before developing the model, you are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.
Study
The dataset is a part of the large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the state of Arizona, USA.
