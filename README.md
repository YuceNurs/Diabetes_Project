Miuul Diabetes Feature Engineering Project 

Case
When the features are provided, it is requested to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not. Before developing the model, you are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.
Study
The dataset is a part of the large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the state of Arizona, USA. The target variable is indicated as 'outcome,' where 1 denotes a positive diabetes test result and 0 denotes a negative result.

There are 9 variables in the dataset:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies  
Glucose : 2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test 
Blood Pressure : Blood Pressure (Diastolic) (mm Hg). 
SkinThickness : Thickness of skin 
Insulin : 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml) 
DiabetesPedigreeFunction : Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test)
BMI : Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in meters)^2) 
Age : Persons age(in years) 
Outcome : Having diabetes status (1: diabetes, 0: no diabetes)
